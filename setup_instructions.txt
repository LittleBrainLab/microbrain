Step 1) Install/Add Third Party Programs to Path:

If Graham has given you a ThirdPartyApp.zip archive, unzip it in any location and add the following to your .bashrc terminal startup file
export PATH="location-of-folder/ThirdPartyApps/:$PATH"

if the following which commands return a path then you can proceed to step 2.
which dcm2niix
which unring.a64
which N4BiasFieldCorrection
which mirtk

The ThirdPartyApp.zip includes 4 following binary files needed for MicroBrain to run.
  dcm2niix - used to convert dicom to nifti, github located https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix
  unring.a64 - gibbs ringing correction binary (Note: uses 64bit architecture), can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/reisert/unring if needed
  N4BiasFieldCorrection - used to normalize signal intensities on the mean DWI image, is included in the ANTS image analysis software package if necessary
  mirtk - used to do surface-based segmentation of subcortical structures and cortex, information about this toolbox can be found at https://mirtk.github.io/

If you don't have the ThirdPartyApp.zip, the easiest way to install mirtk is to run the following commands. Note the release version may change in the following link.
wget -O mirtk https://bintray.com/schuhschuh/AppImages/download_file?file_path=MIRTK-latest-x86_64-glibc2.14.AppImage
chmod a+x mirtk
sudo mv mirtk /usr/bin

Step 2) Install FSL v6.0 or higher from https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation.
	Note: FSL is needed to run the above unring.a64 command, and has multiple other uses in MicroBrain including Eddy current correction and brain masking.

Step 3) Install cuda libraries so that you can run FSL eddy_cuda9.1, which is way faster then normal eddy command 
sudo apt-get install libcudart9.1
sudo apt-get install libcublas9.1

Step 3) Install python modules.
	MicroBrain does most of it's image processing in python, the required python packages can be installed as follows. 

sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install nibabel --user
pip3 install dipy --user
pip3 install fury --user

#NLSAM for denosing and signal stabilization
pip3 install https://github.com/samuelstjean/nlsam/archive/master.zip --user --process-dependency-links
