# MicroBrain
MicroBrain is a fully automated diffusion MRI analysis pipeline for measurement of grey matter microstructure.  Note this pipeline requires the installation of multiple neuroimaging/python analysis software packages (see setup_instructions.txt). Importantly this is a VERY BETA Version use with extreme caution. For trouble shooting help contact Graham Little (gtlittle@ualberta.ca)
